### [About](https://spacebar.chat/)

Spacebar is a free, opensource selfhostable discord-compatible chat, voice and video platform.

* **Selfhostable** ([Setup Docs](https://docs.spacebar.chat/setup/server))
* **Open Source** ([GitHub Organization](https://github.com/spacebarchat))
* **Configurable** (Configure every aspect and limits to your needs)
* **Decentralized** (no abuse of power and doesn't have a single point of failure)
* **Extendable** (secure and cross-platform plugin system)
* **Themeable** (cross-platform theme system with design editor)
* **Secure** (publicly audited and hosted FOSS software for transparent foundation in terms of security)
